# Major versions:
Major versions are denoted by the first number in the version identifier(1.3.6), Here it is 1  
A major version number represents significant changes to the tool.

# Minor versions:
Minor versions are denoted by the second number in the version identifier(1.3.6),Here it is 3.
A minor version number represents smaller changes and additions to the tool.

In Terraform, the version of a module or provider is specified in a file called versions.tf.
This file contains a required_providers block that specifies the required provider and its version number, 
and a terraform block that specifies the required version of Terraform itself.
==================================================
Example: 
=================================================
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 3.0"
}
=====================================================
In this example, the configuration requires a version of Terraform that is greater than or equal to 1.0,
and a version of the AWS provider that is at least version 3.0, but less than version 4.0.

#This symbol ~> is called pessimistic constraint, ~> 3.0 will allow any version in the 3.x range, but will not allow a major version change to 4.0.
When you run terraform init, Terraform will download and install the specified versions of Terraform and any required providers. By specifying the required versions in the versions.tf file, you can ensure that your configurations are consistent and predictable across environments.
